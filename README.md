- Why should we care about your product? Takes a classic game and makes it more enjoyable and dynamic.

## User Stories

- As a user I would like to be able to interact with the game and have it be visually appealing because I would find it more engaging

- As a user I want the application to be able to notify the server of my movements and send me the output after my opponent has moved and vice versa so that I can play the game

- As a player I want the computer to be able to prove a worthy adversary because that will be more fun

- As a user I want to be able to download the application as an mobile application because it will be more engaging

- As a user I would like to play against a computer opponent that is better than just choosing random selections and is harder to play against because it uses an algorithm for selecting targets
